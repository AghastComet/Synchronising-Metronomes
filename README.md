# Synchronising-Metronomes
A simulation of metronomes syncing using the [Kuramoto model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuramoto_model) as explained in [this video by Matt Parker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4PO7NbdKXg).

Metronomes sync when they are placed on a table that can slide in the direction their pendulums.
